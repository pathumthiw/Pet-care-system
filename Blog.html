                    <p class="blogD">Cat, Diseases & Infection, Dog, Health 1 day ago
                    28th September marks World Rabies Day, which encompasses an international awareness movement on the rabies virus and its elimination. 
                    For the second consecutive year, PetVet honors the date through a free anti-rabies vaccination program that intends to mass immunize pets and rescues.
                    Fueled by the success of the preceding year's program, PetVet has subsequently organized an anti-rabies vaccination program for the 28th
                     & 29th of September 2024 from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm, in line with the global 2024 theme-Breaking Rabies Boundaries. 
                     In addition to being administered for absolutely free,
                      the vaccines allocated for the program are of high-quality brands - Rabisin and Nobivac. To ensure efficiency,
                    program participants have been urged to book appointments by contacting the PetVet team at 0112 599 799 or filling the form here.</p>

                        <p class="blogD">
                            It doesn't matter how well-trained your dog is, or how often you follow your potty-break schedule. Sometimes, your dog pees. The best way to make sure that dog urine 
                            doesn't leave a bad stain or stench in your home, however, is to clean it up right away, whether it's on the carpet, hardwood floor, or somewhere else.
                            You need to get rid of the smell after your pet pees on the carpet, on a piece of furniture, on your bed linens, or on your clothes. This will keep your pet from peeing 
                            again because animals like to go back to places where they have urinated if the smell isn't completely gone, so it's important to get rid of it.
                            To figure out why your pet is acting this way, it's important to figure out what's going on given the possibility that this could be a sign of a health problem or stress.
                            Here is your one-stop guide to getting rid of pet urine smells for a variety of surfaces. Let's dive right in!
