        <h5>Why is World Rabies Day Celebrated?</h5>
        <p class="bdetalign">The date commemorates the death of Louis Pasteur, French chemist and microbiologist, who invented the rabies vaccine.
        He administered the first human rabies vaccine in 1885 to a nine-year-old boy who had been severely bitten
            by a rabid dog - and upon succeeding in saving his life, his work popularized, with hundreds flocking to receive his treatment.
            In tribute to his medical breakthrough, World Rabies Day focuses on eradicating the rabies virus altoge .</p>
