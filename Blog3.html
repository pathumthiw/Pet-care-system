        <h2>5 Ways to Clean Pet Urine Odor and Stains</h2>
        
        <p>It doesn't matter how well-trained your dog is, or how often you follow your potty-break schedule. Sometimes,
            your dog pees. The best way to make sure that dog urine doesn't leave a bad stain or stench in your home, however, 
            is to clean it up right away, whether it's on the carpet, hardwood floor, or somewhere else.
            You need to get rid of the smell after your pet pees on the carpet, on a piece of furniture, on your bed linens, 
            or on your clothes. This will keep your pet from peeing again because animals like to go back to places where they 
            have urinated if the smell isn't completely gone, so it's important to get rid of it.
            To figure out why your pet is acting this way, it's important to figure out what's going on given 
            the possibility that this could be a sign of a health problem or stress.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Here is your one-stop guide to getting rid of pet urine smells for a variety of surfaces. Let's dive right in!</p>
        <br>
        <h1>How to Remove Pet Urine Odor from Carpet</h1>
        <br>
        <p>What you should do to assist in removing the odor of cat urine from a surface is as follows</p>
        <h4>1 . Absorb the Urine by Blotting the Spot</h4>

        <p>Locate the stain immediately and blot up as much urine as possible with a clean cloth.</p>

        <h4>2 .Vacuum and Rinse the Area</h4>
        <p>Following that, rinse the area thoroughly with clean water and vacuum the liquid away with a wet/dry vacuum. “Avoid using a steam cleaner, as the heat may set the stain,” Roberts said.</p>

        <h4>3 . Soak the affected area with an enzyme cleaner.</h4>
        <p>While enzyme cleaners are available in a spray bottle, simply spraying a light amount over the stain will accomplish little. Rather than that, remove the sprayer and liberally douse the area.</p>

        <h4>4 .  Allow it to Sit for 10-15 Minutes</h4>
        <p>Allow the cleaner to sit for 10-15 minutes before blotting with a clean cloth.</p>

        <h4>5 . Ensure That Your Cat Does Not Return to the Spot</h4>
        <p>To prevent your pet from returning to the area during the cleaning procedure, cover it with aluminum foil or an aluminum baking sheet, or use an upside-down laundry basket.</p>

        <h4>6 . If necessary, reapply the cleaner</h4>
        <p>For older or extremely odorous stains, you may need to reapply the cleaner and allow it to dry.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Getting Rid of Pet Urine Odors in the Subflooring</h1>

        <p>Urine frequently soaks through the carpet and into the subflooring, leaving a stain and odor that carpet cleaners cannot remove.</p>

        <p>If the pet odor persists despite your best attempts at carpet cleaning, neutralize the odor by applying an oil-based stain-blocking primer to the subfloor beneath the carpeting.
             Replace both the padding and the carpet in that region.</p>
             <br><br>
        <h1>How to Remove Pet Urine Odor from Cushions</h1>
        <p>Here are a few simple techniques for removing the pet urine smell from a cushion.</p>

        <h4>1 . Saturate the area with water.</h4>
        <p>Soak the mattress's damaged region in water. With a cloth, blot up as much of the cat urine as possible.</p>

        <h4>2 . Use an Enzyme Cleaner to Soak the Area</h4>

        <p>Then, slowly pour the enzyme cleaner over and around the afflicted region of the mattress.</p>

        <h4>3 . Allow It to Sit for a Few Minutes Before Blotting With Towels</h4>
        <p>Allow the enzymatic cleanser to rest for 15 minutes before wiping it clean. Make the bed by layering several clean towels over the mattress.</p>

        <h4>4 . Allow the Mattress to Air Dry</h4>
        <p>Replace the towels daily until the mattress dries fully. To discourage peeing on the spot while the mattress cures, cover the bed when not in use with a large plastic sheet or tarp. Additionally, you can purchase a waterproof mattress cover to safeguard your mattress against future instances.</p>

        <h4>5 . Reapply</h4>
        <p>If necessary mattresses may require multiple applications to be fully free of urine.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h1>How to Remove the Smell of Pet Urine from Linens and Clothing</h1>
        <p>When it comes to linens and clothing, one key tip is to NEVER use bleach—when combined with ammonia and urine, it can produce hazardous fumes.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>1 . Use Cool Water to Rinse the Spot</h4>
        <p>If your bedsheets and clothing are machine washable, begin by rinsing the stain in lukewarm water in a sink.</p>

        <h4>2 . Use Detergent and Baking Soda or Cider Vinegar to Clean</h4>
        <p>Add the goods to the washing machine along with 1 cup baking soda or 1/4 cup cider vinegar.</p>

        <h4>3 . Incorporate Enzyme Cleaner If the Odor Remains</h4>
        <p>If the stench of urine persists after the cycle is complete, add enzyme cleaner to the load (as directed on the package) and repeat the cycle.</p>

        <h4>4 . Allow to air dry after washing</h4>
        <p>Always air-dry linens, since the heat from the dryer may seal in the odor before it has a chance to dissipate fully.
        </p>
        <h4>5 . Rinse Again</h4>
        <p>You may need to rewash one or more times to thoroughly remove the odor.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>The Takeaway:</h1>
        <li>Consult your vet to make certain that the reason for your pet's inappropriate peeing or pooping isn't due to bowel or urinary tract issues
        </li>
        <li>Whatever your dog pooped on, DO NOT use bleaching products. Stick to enzyme-based solutions instead.</li>

        <li>The sooner you act, the more probable you are to get rid of the pee odor.</li>
        <br><br>
